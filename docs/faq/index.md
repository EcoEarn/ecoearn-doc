# **FAQ**

### 8.1 **Stake Duration**

The stake duration ranges from a minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 360 days. Longer stake durations yield higher Annual Percentage Rates (APR). You can enter any stake duration in the input field or choose from platform-provided options: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 360 days.

### 8.2 **Unstaking Period (Grace Period)**

After the staking period ends, there is a 7-day grace period. During this time, you can unstake your position, claim rewards, and end the staking. If more than 7 days pass without action, the platform will re-stake all assets based on the remaining stake duration from the most recent staking or additional deposit.

### 8.3 **Renewal**

During the grace period, you can renew your staked assets. The minimum stake duration for renewal is 7 days.

### 8.4 **Reward Release Period**

After claiming rewards, there is a 90-day release period. Rewards are released gradually on days 1, 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90. Detailed reward release information can be viewed on the “Rewards” page.

### 8.5 **Stake Rewards**

You can stake received rewards early, including both released and frozen amounts. For simple staking pools, click ‘Stake rewards’ on the ‘Rewards’ page. For dual-coin pools, visit the ‘Rewards Liquidity Pools’ page and click ‘Add & Stake’.
