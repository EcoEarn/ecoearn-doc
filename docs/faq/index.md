# **FAQ**

**5.1 Lock-up Period**

The lock-up period ranges from a minimum of 7 days to a maximum of 360 days. Longer lock-up periods yield higher Annual Percentage Rates (APR). You can enter any lock-up period in the input field or choose from platform-provided options: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 360 days.

**5.2 Unlocking Period (Grace Period)**

After the staking period ends, there is a 7-day grace period. During this time, you can unlock your position, claim rewards, and end the staking. If more than 7 days pass without action, the platform will re-stake all assets based on the remaining lock-up time from the most recent staking or additional deposit.

**5.3 Renewal**

During the grace period, you can renew your staked assets. The minimum lock-up period for renewal is 7 days.

**5.4 Reward Release Period**

After claiming rewards, there is a 90-day release period. Rewards are released gradually on days 1, 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90. Detailed reward release information can be viewed on the “Rewards” page.

**5.5 Early Reward Staking**

You can stake received rewards early, including those already released and frozen. For single-coin pools, you can perform this action by clicking “Stake early” on the “Rewards” page. For dual-coin pools, visit the “Farms-My Liquidity” page and click “Add & Stake” or “Add Liquidity & Stake”.
