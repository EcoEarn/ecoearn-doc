# **Product Introduction**

## 4.1 Points Staking

### XPSGR Staking

By participating in interactions on the Schrödinger’s Cat platform or creating subdomains on the PixiePoints platform, users earn points ranging from XPSGR-1 to XPSGR-12.

For detailed rules, visit the Schrödinger’s Cat FLUX-Points System.

### 4.1.1 **Staking**

Every day at 0:00, EcoEarn takes a snapshot of your earned XPSGR points and automatically stakes the snapshot from the previous day at 0:00 into the corresponding points pool.

### 4.1.2 **Unlocking**

Points staked automatically are currently not available for unlocking; they continue to generate rewards for you.

### 4.1.3 **Claiming Rewards**

-   Rewards earned from staking in points pools are distributed daily at 0:00. Users can click the “Claim” button to collect them.

### 4.2.3 **Extend Lock-up Period**

### 4.2.4 **Renew**

-   After the lock-up period expires, there will be a 7-day unlocking period (grace period). During this period, you can renew the mining pool by selecting it and clicking the “Renew” button. If no action is taken during the unlocking period, the platform will automatically re-stake based on the total lock-up time from the most recent staking operation (remaining lock-up time + extension time).

![](/img/4.2.4.1.png)

-   In the “Renew” pop-up window, confirm the amount you wish to renew, enter or select the lock-up period (minimum 7 days), and click the “Renew” button to confirm the staking.

## 4.3 Farms (LP Staking)

The logic for staking, adding stake, extending lock-up period, renewing, unlocking, and claiming rewards is the same as for single-coin mining pools. For detailed instructions, please refer to the tutorial in the simple staking section.

### 4.3.1 **Adding Liquidity and Staking**

You can use SGR rewards earned on EcoEarn to add liquidity and stake them early in the Farm pool. The minimum amount for adding liquidity is 10 rewards. If it’s your first time staking, you need to input a lock-up period of at least 7 days. For additional stakes, you must extend the lock-up period accordingly, ensuring it doesn’t fall below the longest release time node of the reward.

-   Go to the Farms page and click on “My Liquidity”.

![](/img/4.3.1.1.png)

-   On the “My Liquidity” page, click the “Add & Stake” button. Alternatively, on the “Market” page, click “Add Liquidity & Stake”, which supports adding liquidity to form LP and staking in the Farm pool.

![](/img/4.3.1.2.png)

-   Confirm the amount of rewards and tokens you are adding, then click “Supply” to confirm the addition.

-   Confirm the amount of LP received and stake simultaneously, input the lock-up period, then click “Confirm stake” to confirm early staking.

### 4.3.2 **Remove Liquidity**

-   Navigate to the “My Liquidity” page and click on “Remove” to remove liquidity.

![](/img/4.3.2.1.png)

-   Confirm the amount of LP tokens you wish to remove and the corresponding amounts of both tokens received, then click “Remove” to proceed.
