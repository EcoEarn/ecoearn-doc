The logic for staking, adding stake, extending lock-up period, renewing, unlocking, and claiming rewards is the same as for single-coin mining pools. For detailed instructions, please refer to the tutorial in the simple staking section.

### 6.1 **Adding Liquidity and Staking**

You can use SGR rewards earned on EcoEarn to add liquidity and stake them early in the Farm pool. The minimum amount for adding liquidity is 10 rewards. If it’s your first time staking, you need to input a lock-up period of at least 7 days. For additional stakes, you must extend the lock-up period accordingly, ensuring it doesn’t fall below the longest release time node of the reward.

-   Go to the Farms page and click on “My Liquidity”.
