### 3.4 **Renew**

-   After the stake duration expires, there is a 7-day unstaking (grace) period. During this time, you can renew the mining pool by selecting it and clicking ‘Renew.’ If no action is taken during the unstaking duration, the platform will automatically re-stake based on the total stake duration from the most recent staking operation (remaining stake duration + extension).
